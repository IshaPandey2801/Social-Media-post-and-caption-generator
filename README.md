# Social-Media-post-and-caption-generator
A Generative AI-based project that creates engaging social media posts and captions using NLP techniques. Built with Python libraries for content generation.

Technologies Used: 
1) Python
2) Hugging Face Transformers (for generative AI models)
3) Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and spaCy (for NLP preprocessing)
4) Google Collab (for prototyping and testing)


Challenges Faced:
1) Irrelevant and repetitive captions:
Solved by applying advanced text generation techniques like top-k sampling and temperature tuning for more coherent outputs.

2) Grammar errors in generated text:
Added a post-processing step using grammar correction tools to refine outputs.

3) Limited dataset diversity:
Augmented data with additional social media content to improve creativity and relevance.
